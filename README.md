# pendulum-simulation
Simulated pendulum motion under varying gravity using Python and Euler’s method, with visualizations validating theoretical predictions.

## Problem
Simulating pendulum motion under varying gravitational forces is a classical physics problem. Numerical solutions help study dynamics where analytical solutions are limited.

## Solution
This project uses Python and the **Euler method** to simulate pendulum motion. It visualizes motion for different gravitational accelerations and compares results with theoretical predictions.

## Structure
- `src/` → simulation and visualization code
